// lblcalc is a program to do line-by-line transmittance calculations for a given atmosphere. These calculations may be done at various wavelengths and for given atmospheric structures. Jobs may be run in batch; sent to a server; or may be specified, saved and loaded through a command-line or ncurses-based interface.
// The ncurses interface is based on some old code that I had lying about.
