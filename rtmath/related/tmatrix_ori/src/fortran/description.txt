C   INPUT PARAMETERS:                                                  
C                                                                      
C      AXI - equivalent-sphere radius                                  
C      RAT = 1 - particle size is specified in terms of the            
C                equal-volume-sphere radius                             
C      RAT.ne.1 - particle size is specified in terms of the           
C                equal-surface-area-sphere radius                      
C      LAM - WAVELENGTH OF INCIDENT LIGHT                                       
C      MRR and MRI - real and imaginary parts of the refractive        
C                  index                                               
C      EPS and NP - specify the shape of the particles.                
C             For spheroids NP=-1 and EPS is the ratio of the          
C                 horizontal to rotational axes.  EPS is larger than   
C                 1 for oblate spheroids and smaller than 1 for        
C                 prolate spheroids.                                   
C             For cylinders NP=-2 and EPS is the ratio of the          
C                 diameter to the length.                              
C             For Chebyshev particles NP must be positive and 
C                 is the degree of the Chebyshev polynomial, while     
C                 EPS is the deformation parameter (Ref. 5).          
C             For generalized Chebyshev particles (describing the shape
C                 of distorted water drops) NP=-3.  The coefficients
C                 of the Chebyshev polynomial expansion of the particle
C                 shape (Ref. 7) are specified in subroutine DROP.
C      DDELT - accuracy of the computations                            
C      NDGS - parameter controlling the number of division points      
C             in computing integrals over the particle surface (Ref. 5).   
C             For compact particles, the recommended value is 2.       
C             For highly aspherical particles larger values (3, 4,...) 
C             may be necessary to obtain convergence.                  
C             The code does not check convergence over this parameter. 
C             Therefore, control comparisons of results obtained with  
C             different NDGS-values are recommended.                   
C      ALPHA and BETA - Euler angles (in degrees) specifying the orientation 
C            of the scattering particle relative to the laboratory reference
C            frame (Refs. 6 and 7).
C      THET0 - zenith angle of the incident beam in degrees   
C      THET - zenith angle of the scattered beam in degrees      
C      PHI0 - azimuth angle of the incident beam in degrees     
C      PHI - azimuth angle of the scattered beam in degrees   
C            (Refs. 6 and 7)
C      ALPHA, BETA, THET0, THET, PHI0, and PHI are specified at the end of
C      the main program before the line                                    
C

C                                                                      
C      The part of the main program following the line 
C                                                                      
C       "COMPUTATION OF THE AMPLITUDE AND PHASE MATRICES"               
C                                                                      
C      can be repeated any number of times.  By this time the T-matrix 
C      for the given scattering particle has already     
C      been fully computed and can be repeatedly used in computations  
C      for any directions of illumination and scattering and any particle
C      orientations.
