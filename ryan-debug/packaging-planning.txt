Planning for Wix installers:

Scripting:
- Take object, run config for x86, x64 and all combinations of build settings
- Install these to a test install directory
- Create a batch script to:
 - Ensure everything signable is signed
 - Run Wix on this directory

Ryan_Debug
- First installer needed.
- Available as a merge module.
- Versions:
 - x86 / x64
- Dependencies:
 - Visual C++ / Intel runtimes
 - boost filesystem, program_options, system
  - export as a merge module matching the necessary configuration?
  - static on intel, dynamic on others
- DLL and EXE signing
- Package signing
- Upgradable
 - Requires a bootstrapper
- Needs a user interface to specify install options and location
- CMake registry entries
- environment-modules support for loading modules
- standard system path support
- look into customizing dll library load locations in the linker

- Register Ryan_Debug-test in 
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths



First, create the boost sxs assembly
- One for each boost version + compiler combination + build flags
 - Boost dlls require zlib1.dll and libbz2.dll
